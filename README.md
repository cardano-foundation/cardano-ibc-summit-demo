# Cardano Summit 2025 IBC Masterclass Demo
This application aims to demonstrate the Cardano's IBC connectivity capabilities by implementing a simple Oracle service running on a Cosmos SDK based chain connected to Cardano via IBC. It fetches information from public ship data APIs, uses Cosmos vote extensions for aligning on a value among different data sources, sends this data via IBC to Cardano where it is picked up by a smart contract that processes it and delivers an outcome back to the Cosmos chain via IBC.
